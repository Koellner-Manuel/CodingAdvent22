# CodingAdvent22 :christmas_tree:
This Repository contains my code solutions for the "Advent of Code - 2022" activity. The solutions are written in **TypeScript**. 
I can really recommend this activity if you're new to programming, want to learn a new language or just want to improve your skills - as I do with **TS**.

Wanna try it yourself? The description of each day (programming puzzle) can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

## Get my code!
**Feel free to have a look into my code** - I would really appreciate it. If you find any code smells or just bad syntax habits -> let me know. 
Furthermore if you are new to TypeScript and do not know how to execute it, here are some little steps.

* First of all you should have installed [*node.js*](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). _Check with `npm --version` if it has already been installed!_
* Next you should run a shell and enter `npm install -g typescript` to install typescript
* Clone or even fork my repo and open it in any **editor** (_e.g.: Visual Studio Code_)
* _cd_ to the local cloned repo path and run `npm install` to get all the node modules
* Finally just run `node build/main` or launch it via your own config ...

_... You should now see all my results for the different days/puzzles._

## Merry Christmas and Happy Coding :santa::christmas_tree::computer::vulcan_salute:
